Add/Edit Staff
1. Created a Dummy account and assigned role 'Manager' to it. Username: dummy, password: Dummy2023*
2. As site admin I'm able to edit Dummy's profile. Added raspberry to Dummy's description and updated the profile
3. Guest accounts are unable to add/edit staff because they have no admin privileges.
